\section{Introduction}
Sign languages are used by deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals to communicate with one another and with the hearing population. There are over 300 different sign languages used throughout the world, each with its own unique grammar and vocabulary. Sign language recognition technology aims to provide a means of automatically interpreting sign language and translating it into text or speech for the benefit of the hearing population.

Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have made it possible to develop sign language recognition systems using sensor gloves. These gloves contain multiple sensors that measure various parameters related to hand movement and position. Machine learning algorithms can then be used to analyze the sensor data and recognize the corresponding sign language gestures.

In this chapter, we will provide an overview of sign languages and sign language recognition technology. We will discuss the challenges associated with sign language recognition and the potential benefits of developing such technology. Finally, we will present an overview of the rest of the paper.
