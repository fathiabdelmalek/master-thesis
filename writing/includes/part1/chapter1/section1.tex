\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
Deaf, mute, and hard-of-hearing people, have their language system, its \ac{sl}, there are over 300 different \ac{sl} used in the world, and each one has a unique grammar and vocabulary, one of them is \ac{asp}, is used by more than 240,000 individuals around Algeria "\cite{ethnologue}. \ac{slr} technology aims to provide a means of automatically interpreting SL and translating it into text or speech, to facilitate the communication process between normal and deaf/mute people.
\paragraph{}
Recent advancements in wearable sensor technology have made it possible to develop \ac{slr} systems using sensor gloves. These gloves contain multiple sensors that measure various parameters related to hand movement and position. \ac{ml} and \ac{dl} algorithms can then be used to analyze the sensor data and recognize the corresponding \ac{sl} gestures.
\paragraph{}
In this chapter, we will provide an overview of sign languages and \ac{slr} technology. We will discuss the challenges associated with \ac{slr} and the potential benefits of developing such technology.
