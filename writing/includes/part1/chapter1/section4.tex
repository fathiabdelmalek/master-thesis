\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
In this chapter, we have introduced sign languages and the importance of \ac{slr} systems in facilitating communication between deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals and the hearing world. We have also presented a review of the literature on \ac{slr} systems, including the techniques and methodologies that have been used to develop these systems.
\paragraph{}
From our review, it is clear that \ac{slr} is a challenging task that requires the use of sophisticated techniques such as \ac{ml}, computer vision, and signal processing. While progress has been made in this area, there are still many open challenges that need to be addressed, such as improving the accuracy and robustness of recognition systems, developing systems that can recognize different sign languages, and addressing the issue of data sparsity.
\paragraph{}
In summary, the field of \ac{slr} is a promising area of research with many potential applications. We hope that this chapter has provided the reader with a good understanding of the current state of the art in \ac{slr} and the challenges that lie ahead.
