\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we have presented the requirements analysis and specification for the development of the Takalem gloves, which will be used for sign language recognition. We started by providing an overview of the project goals and context, followed by a detailed description of the functional and non-functional requirements.

We have also discussed the challenges associated with developing a sign language recognition system and the importance of selecting appropriate sensors, hardware, and software components to ensure optimal performance. Our analysis highlights the importance of considering factors such as accuracy, latency, power consumption, and cost when selecting these components.

In conclusion, the requirements analysis and specification presented in this chapter provide a comprehensive framework for the development of the Takalem gloves. The proposed system will leverage advanced deep learning techniques to recognize sign language gestures accurately and efficiently, enabling individuals with hearing and speech impairments to communicate more effectively. In the next chapter, we will focus on the design and implementation of the Takalem gloves, which will involve selecting and integrating the appropriate sensors, hardware, and software components to meet the identified requirements.
