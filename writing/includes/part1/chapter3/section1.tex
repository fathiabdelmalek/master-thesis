\section{Introduction}
In this chapter, we will present the requirements analysis and specification for the design and implementation of Takalem gloves, a system for sign language recognition based on sensors embedded in gloves. This section serves as an introduction to the chapter, providing an overview of the content and context of the requirements analysis and specification.

First, we will explain the importance of requirements analysis and specification in the development of software systems, highlighting how it enables stakeholders to define and agree on the functionality, constraints, and quality attributes of a system before it is built. This is especially relevant for Takalem gloves, as it is a complex system that involves hardware, software, and human interaction.

Next, we will outline the structure of this chapter, which is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the requirements specification for Takalem gloves, which includes functional and non-functional requirements, as well as constraints and assumptions. Section 3 provides a justification and explanation of the requirements specification, discussing why each requirement is necessary and how it contributes to the overall goal of the system. Finally, Section 4 concludes the chapter, summarizing the main findings and implications of the requirements analysis and specification.
