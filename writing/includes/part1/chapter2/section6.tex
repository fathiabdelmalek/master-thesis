\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
\ac{slr} is a complex task that involves the use of advanced algorithms and techniques in computer vision, \ac{ml}, and \ac{dl}. The development of \ac{slr} systems has made it possible for the deaf community to communicate more effectively with people who do not understand \ac{sl}.
\paragraph{}
We have discussed the different methods used in \ac{slr} such as \ac{ann} and \ac{lstm}. We have also talked about some datasets commonly used in \ac{slr} research, as well as evaluation metrics that are frequently employed to assess the performance of these systems.
\paragraph{}
There have been significant advancements in \ac{dl}-based approaches for \ac{slr} over recent years. However, much work still needs to be done to improve accuracy rates further. More comprehensive data sets need to be created with more diverse sets of gestures so that models can learn better.
\paragraph{}
All things considered; we believe that continued research into new algorithms and techniques will pave the way for even more sophisticated \ac{slr} systems capable of discerning subtle nuances between signs accurately.
