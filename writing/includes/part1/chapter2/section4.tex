\section{Synthesis}
\paragraph{}
Other methods and techniques, such as decision trees, rule-based systems, and \ac{dtw}, \ac{tcn}, have also been explored in this context. Each method has its own strengths and limitations, and their suitability depends on the specific requirements of the task and available data.
\paragraph{}
It is worth noting that the choice of \ac{slr} method often depends on the characteristics of the dataset, the complexity of the gestures, and the available computational resources. Researchers continue to explore and develop novel methods and hybrid approaches to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this systems.
