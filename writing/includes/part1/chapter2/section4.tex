\section{Challenges and Future Directions}
\paragraph{}
While significant progress has been made in the field of \ac{slr}, several challenges remain. Variability in \ac{sl}s, limited availability of annotated datasets, and the need for real-time recognition are among the key challenges faced by researchers. Future directions in \ac{slr} include exploring multimodal approaches that combine visual and sensor-based data, addressing the domain adaptation problem to make \ac{slr} models more robust across different environments, and leveraging transfer learning techniques to reduce the reliance on large amounts of annotated data.
\paragraph{}
The works and advancements discussed in this section have collectively contributed to the development of accurate and efficient \ac{slr} systems. They serve as a foundation for ongoing research and inspire further innovations in the field.
