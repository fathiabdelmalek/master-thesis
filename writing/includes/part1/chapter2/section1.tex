\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{}
\ac{slr} is the task of automatically recognizing the signs in a video or image of a signer. It is a challenging task due to the variability of \ac{sl} production, including the signer's hand shape, movement, location, and facial expression.
\paragraph{}
Datasets are essential for training and evaluating \ac{slr} systems. They provide a large and diverse set of examples of signs, which allows the system to learn the different factors that contribute to sign recognition.
\paragraph{}
This chapter explores various types of datasets employed in \ac{slr}, including image-based, video-based, sensor-based, and discusses well-known and standard datasets, and also custom-made datasets, Additionally, we will discuss the different data acquisition methods employed. Furthermore, we delve into the methods of \ac{slr} applied, and provide an overview of the results obtained. Finally, we conclude the chapter by summarizing the key findings and highlighting future directions for \ac{slr} research.
