\section{Datasets for training and evaluation}
\paragraph{}
Datasets are essential for training and evaluating \ac{slr} systems. These datasets are used to train \ac{slr} systems to recognize signs and to evaluate the accuracy of \ac{slr} systems.
\paragraph{}
There are a number of different datasets available. But the majority of them fall under one of the following three types.:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Image-based datasets:} consist of static images capturing sign language gestures or symbols. These datasets are often derived from larger video datasets or captured explicitly for image-based recognition tasks.
	\item \textbf{Video-based datasets:} contain continuous sequences of sign language gestures or sentences. These datasets provide a more comprehensive representation of sign language and allow for temporal analysis.
	\item \textbf{Sensor-based datasets:} leverage various sensing modalities, such as gloves with sensors, depth cameras, or inertial measurement units (IMUs). These datasets capture the movements and positions of the signer's hands and body, enabling fine-grained analysis of sign language.
\end{itemize}

In table \ref{tab:standard-datasets}, we will have a look at the most popular used datasets:

Due to the short time and lack of required materials, we couldn't create our custom \ac{asp} dataset. For that, we searched for a "Sensor-based" dataset that should be made with custom gloves that contain \ac{imu} and Flex sensors to collect acceleration signals and bent fingers from the hand. Thankfully, we found the dataset "DU-ASL-DATA-GLOVE-DB", made with a glove for \ac{asl} signs that require just one hand, this dataset was collected by Atick et al"\cite{ref-article}.
