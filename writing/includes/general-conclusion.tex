\chapter*{General Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
In this report, we have tackled the challenge of \ac{slr} using \ac{dl} techniques. Despite the lack of existing approaches for \ac{asp} recognition, we have successfully developed and evaluated a \ac{dl} model using sensor-based \ac{asl} datasets. Our results demonstrate the potential of \ac{dl}, particularly \ac{lstm}, in accurately recognizing \ac{asl} gestures. Moreover, we have implemented the model on the ESP32 microcontroller, enabling real-time \ac{slr} on low-power and portable devices. While the absence of a dedicated \ac{asp} dataset remains a limitation, our work serves as a foundation for future research in this domain. Collecting a comprehensive dataset and refining the recognition model for \ac{asp} are crucial next steps. By promoting inclusivity and accessibility, we aim to inspire further advancements in \ac{slr} and empower individuals with hearing impairments.
