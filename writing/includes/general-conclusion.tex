\chapter*{General Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
In conclusion, our research on the gloves system has demonstrated the potential of wearable devices and \ac{dl} algorithms for \ac{slr}. By providing real-time interpretation of \ac{sl} gestures, these technologies have the power to bridge communication barriers and foster inclusivity for individuals with hearing impairments. The results obtained from our experiments showcase the effectiveness and promise of the system in accurately classifying \ac{sl} gestures.
\paragraph{}
However, it is important to acknowledge the limitations and challenges that still exist in the field. The availability of comprehensive and diverse datasets specific to \ac{sl}s remains a significant hurdle, and efforts should be made to collect and curate large-scale datasets to train and evaluate future models. Additionally, the robustness of the system in handling variations in hand shapes, speeds, and styles of signing can be further explored and improved.
