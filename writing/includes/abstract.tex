	Sign language recognition plays a crucial role in facilitating communication between individuals with hearing impairments and non-signers. However, the lack of an Algerian Sign Language (ASP) dataset and limited time constraints pose challenges in developing a customized dataset. In this study, an existing American Sign Language (ASL) dataset is utilized, and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is employed for sign classification. The LSTM model achieves an accuracy of 86.16\% for character-level classification and an impressive 98.05\% for word-level classification. Remarkably, the model exhibits minimal errors in word classification and infrequent errors in character classification, primarily due to the selection of the most frequently predicted sign from a pool of 150 predictions per gesture. While these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the model.
