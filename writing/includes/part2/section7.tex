\section{Conclusion}
\paragraph{}
Our study focused on utilizing a pre-existing sensor-based \ac{asl} dataset to train a \ac{dl} model for \ac{slr}. Due to time constraints and limited resources, we leveraged the \ac{asl} dataset, which contains 40 different signs, including 26 letters and 14 words. The dataset was collected from 25 subjects, with each subject repeating each gesture 10 times, resulting in a total of 150,000 records.

However, it is important to note the limitations of our research. The use of an \ac{asl} dataset instead of a dedicated \ac{asp} dataset is a significant limitation. While the \ac{asl} dataset provided a foundation for our research, it may not fully capture the unique characteristics and nuances of \ac{asp}. Therefore, future work should focus on collecting a dedicated \ac{asp} dataset to train the model specifically for Arabic sign language recognition.
