\section{Conclusion}
In this chapter, we reviewed several methods of sign language recognition that have been proposed in the literature. We observed that the most common approach is to use computer vision techniques to extract features from video data and then use machine learning algorithms to classify the signs. We also discussed the limitations of these methods, particularly in terms of their accuracy and speed.

Despite the challenges, there have been several promising developments in recent years, including the use of deep learning models and the integration of wearable sensors. These advancements have shown the potential for more accurate and efficient sign language recognition systems.

In the next chapter, we will outline the requirements and specifications for our proposed sign language recognition system.
